# Scenario:
# You've been hired by the New York Division of Transportation as a Data Analyst with the primary goal of improving the efficiency and reliability of the city's bus transportation system. The city has been experiencing a significant number of bus breakdowns and delays, which has been causing inconvenience to commuters and straining the city's public transportation resources.

# Your task is to analyze the provided data to identify patterns and factors that contribute to these breakdowns and delays. 

# Questions: 
# What are the most common reasons for delays and breakdowns?
# How do delay times vary by bus company and borough?
# Is there a correlation between specific days of the week and the frequency of breakdowns or delays?


# Clean the dataset
# 1. Cleaned the 'Occurred_On' column by using WEEKDAY function to find the weekday of each day of when the breakdown/delay ocurred. One being Sunday and seven being Saturday. 
# 2. Standardized the bus company names. There were several instances of the same company name. For example: 'Thomas Buses, Inc.' had different numbers at then end of some names. Those numbers were removed and all Thomas Buses have been standarized to 'Thomas Buses, Inc.'
# 3. Split the minute ranges under the 'How_Long_Delay column using the 'Text to Column' tool. The lower number moved to one side and the higher number to the other side. 

# Pivot tables and charts were created for all three questions to find out the answers.
